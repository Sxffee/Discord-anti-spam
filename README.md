# Discord-anti-spam
This was made in replit IDE so the keep_alive file isn't needed unless you are gonna use replit.

As a new discord.py dev I wanna share a small project I made. If you use this code, you can change up the sleep time and the other timeing statements.

When you run the code make sure you add a empty .txt file called spam_bank.txt
